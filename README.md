# Portfolio-Website

A portfolio website using basic HTML and CSS is a simple website that showcases a person's skills, projects, and experiences. The website typically consists of several pages, including a home page, an about page, a portfolio page, and a contact page.

The home page usually includes a brief introduction and links to the other pages. The about page provides more information about the person, such as their education, work experience, and skills. The portfolio page showcases their work, such as projects they have completed or samples of their designs.

The contact page typically includes a contact form or email address, allowing visitors to get in touch with the person. The website design is typically clean and professional, with a focus on the person's work and accomplishments.

To create the website, basic HTML tags such as <html>, <head>, <body>, and <h1> are used to structure the content. CSS is used to style the website, including fonts, colors, and layout. Basic CSS techniques such as using classes and IDs, applying styles to specific elements, and using external style sheets are used to create a cohesive design. Overall, a portfolio website using basic HTML and CSS is a great way to showcase one's skills and work in a simple and professional manner.
